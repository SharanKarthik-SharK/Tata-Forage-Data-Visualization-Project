## 🗣️ Executive Presentation Script

**[CEO/CMO Video Presentation Script]**

> Hello, I’m Sharan P. This Power BI analysis supports Tata’s international expansion and sales strategy. I started by cleaning our dataset—removing returns, invalid prices, and incomplete customer records. For each executive question, I built an interactive dashboard focused on actionable business answers.
>
> 1. **Monthly Revenue Trends (2011):** Reveals seasonal patterns and peak months. Highest revenue in November points to key inventory periods.
> 2. **Top Countries by Revenue:** Netherlands and EIRE offer biggest non-UK growth opportunities. Product breakdown shows where to adjust marketing and supply.
> 3. **Top Customers:** A few customers drive outsized sales. Valuable for prioritizing retention and loyalty efforts.
> 4. **Demand Map:** Highlights strong European and Australian markets, with potential beyond.
>
> **Recommendations:** Focus expansion in high-revenue countries, tailor offerings to local demand, and build loyalty among core customers. Back peak periods with supply and targeted campaigns.
>
> Thank you for your time. I’m happy to discuss next steps or strategic questions.
